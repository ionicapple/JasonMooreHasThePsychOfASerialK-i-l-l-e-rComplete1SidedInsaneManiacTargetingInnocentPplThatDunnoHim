# JasonMooreHasThePsychOfASerialK-i-l-l-e-rComplete1SidedInsaneManiacTargetingInnocentPplThatDunnoHim

and i was around this person when i was at penn who is absolutely insane isnt that wild, thats so crazy

its wild what violent white trash with average intelligence can come up with if anyone gives them a platform

but u know what a criminal wants, esp a serial k i l l e r ... they want to commit the "perfect crime" where they can just get away with their crime and that's not going to happen here

u should know that i know things about him and paul that im not sharing and never shared, theres more to this that im not sharing but its more evidence that hes/theyre psychos

no matter wut tho hes been our little b*tch since 2017, whatever we say and do triggers him bc hes a weakling lol, a simple coward hiding behind a screen
